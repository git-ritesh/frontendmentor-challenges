## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a pretty basic challenge. But it helped me to recall the concepts related to `background` properties. for e.g. `background-size`, `background-repeat` etc. as I hadn't used these properties in my recent past projects. 

### Continued development

I want to focus on these areas in the upcoming projects. 
  - Using more semantic HTML
  - How to write more efficient code
  - Reduce Code Quantity, Improve Code Reusability & Readibility
  - Learn the Concepts of Grid
