### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

- Flexbox can help you in making a very responsive and beautiful layouts with ease. 

- Flex-items shrink themselves to a minimum size they can possibly get. 

- Media Query is an essential part in making the Webpage Responsive. 

- If you give `width: 100%;` to a `flex-item` it will try to take up the maximum size it can get in the `flex-container`. 

- By default the Flexbox doesn't wraps the flex-items. 

### Continued development

1. **Flexbox** : Though I've used Flexbox in this project but I'm still not familiar with all the things which revolve around flexbox. So I'm gonna focus on getting a dedper knowledge of flexbox for apply them in future projects.

2. **Media Queries** : This is my first project in which i used Media Query for making Responsive Page and it felt a little bit complex to grasp a full understanding of Media Queries. So I'm gonna take a deeper dive into it also.
