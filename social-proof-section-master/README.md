## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I gained a more clear understanding of flexbox and learned about `background` and its child properties like `background-origin`, `background-repeat`, `background-size` & `background-position` etc. 


### Continued development

I'm looking forward to learn Javascript for making my webpages more awesome with interactiveness. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Backgrounds](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.php) - This helped me to learn about CSS Background Properties.
