## My process

- Broke the layout into vertical & horizontal Nested Layouts.

- Created containers for holding images and text inside it.

- A parent container for holding all the containers. 

- set the display of the `<main>` to `flex` to vertically center the component.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first ever mobile-first approach I followed to make something. Though this was a pretty basic challenge to do. Still I learned how we can make responsive things without using Media Queries & avoid writing so many properties for a single element over & over for different screen sizes.

### Continued development

How we can take the approach of making things responsive without too many complexities.
